Hi everyone!

My name is Joe Dorfman and I am currently enrolled in General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program. Throughout this program and beyond, I will use this site as a blog to post my thoughts on different topics and also as a portfolio page for the data science related projects that I create. I hope you all enjoy!

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments: joedorfman@gmail.com. Would be great to hear from you!

-Joe
